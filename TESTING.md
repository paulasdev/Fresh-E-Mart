## Lighthouse 

I Used Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools to test each of the pages for:

- Performance - How the page performs whilst loading.
- Accessibility - How accessible is the site for all users and how can it be improved.
- Best Practices - How does the site conform to industry best practices.
- SEO - Search engine optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

- As an example, the results for the Fresh-E-Mart website for both Mobile.
